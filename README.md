# Feeling Like Playing
This small project is a game selector.<br>
It is still in its initial stages, with much more to add and improve.<br>
The project holds a main screen in Streamlit, and runs the games in CMD or TKinter. It also has a sentence_transformer in it.

## Running the Code
` streamlit run .\Feeling_like_Playing.py ` <br>

## Feeling Like Playing App
When you feel like playing, you can choose if you want to select a game from list / describe the game you feel like playing and get a suggestion / answer a small questionnaire that will direct the suggestion of the game you feel like playing / be surprised with a randomly selected game.<br>
Once a game is selected, you have a option to open the game's description, and start playing.<br>

<br>
If it is a CMD game, it will open in the terminal or window where you run the Feeling Like Playing app. If it is a TKinter game, it will open a window. You cannot continue with the app until you finish or close the game.

Enjoy!

## Future Work:
1. Have games run in a separate window. <br>
2. Improve the free text transformer. <br>
3. Improve the questionnaire. <br>
4. Add games.
